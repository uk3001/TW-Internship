ATM_Interface
ATM Machine. Welcome to the ATM Interface repository!

ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface project in Java is to create a simulation of an ATM system that allows users to perform various banking transactions, such as withdrawing cash, checking account balance, depositing money, and transferring funds between accounts. The project aims to provide a user-friendly and secure interface to interact with the ATM functionalities.

Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language for building the ATM functionality.

Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system to write and compile Java code.

ATM Interface
Transaction Processing: Implement the logic to process various ATM transactions, such as cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, deposits, and fund transfers.
